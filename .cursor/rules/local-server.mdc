# Local Development Server

Always use **port 8000** for the local HTML server in this project.

## How to Start
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

## Troubleshooting
If you see an error like `OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use`, it means port 8000 is occupied. 

1. **Find the process ID (PID):**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8000
   ```
2. **Kill the process:**
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```
3. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

Note: While port 3000 is mentioned in some user rules as a priority, this specific project is configured to use **port 8000**.
